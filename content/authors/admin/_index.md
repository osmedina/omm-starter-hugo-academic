Hello! I am an Interdisciplinary researcher/practitioner. Currently, I am a Ph.D. candidate in Anthropology at the University of Florida (specialization: governance and public policy). My background includes socioeconomic development & environment, sustainable development, and agricultural sciences.\
\
I have worked in various policy and management positions in the Ecuadorian Ministry of Agriculture and the Provincial Government of Loja-Ecuador. I have worked and conducted interdisciplinary research in several countries, including my native Ecuador (agricultural development), Costa Rica (water governance), Honduras (Feed the Future – USAID), Brazil (Programa de Municípios Sustentáveis), Bolivia (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations). I hold an M.A. in Sustainable Development Practice from the University of Florida (EEUU), and a B.Sc. in Socioeconomic Development and Environment from Zamorano University (Honduras).
